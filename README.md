(In my computer, maven has a problem when I run a test of my code. I spent more than 2 days to solve this problem but I can't, so I just submit that the unit test part is not done yet. Also, because of that I submitted my stage 1 assignment too late. I feel really sorry.)

# How to submit your project output for each stage
1. Open <code>pom.xml</code> and change the artifect ID from <code>2016000000</code> to your student ID.
2. Complete templates:
   * Stage 1: Complete <code>edu.hanyang.submit.TinySETokenizer.javaM</code>file.
   * Stage 2: Complete <code>edu.hanyang.submit.TinySEExternalSort.java</code> file.
   * Stage 3: Complete <code>edu.hanyang.submit.TinySEBPlusTree.java</code> file.
   * Stage 4: Complete <code>edu.hanyang.submit.TinySEQueryProcess.java</code> file.
3. Run <code>mvn package</code>.
4. If you pass every unit test successfully, upload <code>&lt;your student ID&gt;-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> file on the web board.
